# Finding-the-shortest-paths
The program makes a weighted graph with the cities as nodes and the cost and time as weights in FlightData.txt. 
The program searches the three shortest path by cost and time between departure and destination in RequestedFlightData.txt. Also, it reads the database to make weighted edges and a weighted graph to implement the searching algorithm. Stack and back tracking are used to implement Depth-first search to print out the result. Finally, the program outputs a file.

1. Compile and run flightPlan.java.
2. Argument: <flight data> <requested data> <output file name>
